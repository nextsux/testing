SparkleShare-Dashboard - A simple web interface to your SparkleShare server.


Manifesto
=========

SparkleShare-Dashboard provides users with a simple web interface to 
their SparkleShare server. It will provide a mechanism to authorize more 
devices; a service that handles announcements to other clients; a web API 
that mobile device clients are able to hook up to, and a way to see your
folders from your browser (if not encrypted).

The interface should be really easy to set up. 

Ofcourse, "easy" is a relative term, and people are usually considered 
geeky already when they have their own private (virtual) server.

However, many people know how to set up a basic website, or how to set up
a Wordpress blog, so they can help others who are less interested in
digital technology, but do care about privacy and freedom.

So that is the goal: simplicity. You should be able to set up 
SparkleShare-Dashboard in no more than 3 terminal commands. This includes 
logging into your server and download the package. From there, it needs 
to Just Work (TM). After that, you should be able to connect to it by 
providing the address (given) and a PIN, or a button that opens a file with 
a SparkleShare mimetype, so it take only one click to connect.


Design decisions
================

The server will be build on NodeJS. This is for several reasons: it doesn't 
have many dependencies (in fact it compiles on most default systems), it's 
easy to add javascript libraries, it's light, and it seems to be all the 
rage lately.


UI design
